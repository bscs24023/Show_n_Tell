We held a zoom meeting in which we discussed our topic "Sets". We distributed the work amongst the 5 members.
Everyone has a different role and we'll be working on our parts and also help and edit eachothers work when needed. 

On Friday the whole group came together to construct a draft of our presentation:
Slide 1

Slide 2-3
Introduction 

Sets definition
Union
Intersection
Difference

Slide 4
Cartesian Product (1 slide)
Definition and Visualisation

Slide 5
Code

Slide 6

Slide 7
Live demo of set calculator 

Slide 8-9
Cartesian Product Theories
Cartesian product in Set theory and Cartesian product
Cartesian Product in Logic and Computability.

Slide 10-11
Applications in real life

Slide 12
Daily life Applications

Slide 13
Daily life Application Puzzle (Interactive)

Slide 14
Conclusion 
On Monday Oct 28 We had a small discussion about the algorithm of our code that we will be using in our presentation We wrote our Algorithm and Pseudo Code

Areej:
Today I started working on my code for the Set Calculator. I learnt Dynamic arrays as they will be used in my code and we have not covered it in our course yet. Thus, I have started self learning.
I also started finding information on Cartesian Product Theories, specifically Cartesian Product in Logic and Computability.

Rabia: 
Today I worked a bit more on code and learnt how to make a console application I am taking it bit by bit. But I am tryinng to make an application

Maryam:
I have started working on the introductory slides which will cover the fundamental definition of sets and their classification.
