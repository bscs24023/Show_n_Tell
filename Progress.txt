Day 1:
Areej-
We held a zoom meeting in which we discussed our topic "Sets". We distributed the work amongst the 5 members.
Everyone has a different role and we'll be working on our parts and also help and edit eachothers work when needed. 

On Friday the whole group came together to construct a draft of our presentation:
Slide 1
Overview

Slide 2-3
Introduction 

Sets definition
Union
Intersection
Difference

Slide 4
Cartesian Product (1 slide)
Definition and Visualisation

Slide 5
Code

Slide 6
Output

Slide 7
Live demo of set calculator 

Slide 8-9
Cartesian Product Theories
Cartesian product in Set theory and Cartesian product
Cartesian Product in Logic and Computability.

Slide 10-11
Applications in real life
Database
Machine Learning

Slide 12
Daily life Applications

Slide 13
Daily life Application Puzzle (Interactive)

Slide 14
Conclusion 
On Monday Oct 28 We had a small discussion about the algorithm of our code that we will be using in our presentation We wrote our Algorithm and Pseudo Code

Areej:
Today I started working on my code for the Set Calculator. I learnt Dynamic arrays as they will be used in my code and we have not covered it in our course yet. Thus, I have started self learning.
I also started finding information on Cartesian Product Theories, specifically Cartesian Product in Logic and Computability.

Rabia: 
Today I worked a bit more on code and learnt how to make a console application I am taking it bit by bit. But I am tryinng to make an application

Maryam:
I have started working on the introductory slides which will cover the fundamental definition of sets and their classification.

Hafsa:
I'm currently gathering data on the daily life applications of Cartesian Product using different resources on the internet as well as textbooks on statistical maths. 

Areej:
My topic of research is Cartesian Product in Logic and Computability. I am currently doing research on automata and the application of Cartesian product in it. Here are some of the papers and websites I have used:
https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2004-05/automata-theory/basics.html
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344546618_CARTESIAN_PRODUCT_OF_AUTOMATA

Maryam:
I am currently working on the application of the cartesian product in relational databases,specifically focusing on how different join operations are used to combine data from multiple tables.
The following are some of the websites that i am using for my research and understanding:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cartesian-join/
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp

Hafsa:
I've been looking closely at how Cartesian Product is useful in our everyday lives. I've gathered some useful information such as how online shopping websites and travel agencies use Cartesian Product. I took help from:
https://www.softpost.org/iit-jee/real-world-applications-of-cartesian-products-concept


Rameen: I am currently researching on applications of cartesian product in set theory along with the codes for set calculator.
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/878748/the-use-of-cartesian-product
using this site along with some Youtube videos for research

Rameen: I am currently researching on ZF set theory which consists of a collection of axioms that describe how sets behave and make cartesian product mathematically rigorous.
